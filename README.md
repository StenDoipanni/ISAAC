### What is ISAAC?

ISAAC is a modular ontology for Image Schema Analysis And Comparison, building a new top image schematic roles level on frames represented and formalized in [Framester](https://github.com/framester/Framester).
Its design applies the [COntPare]() methodology for epistemic ontology comparison at the domain of image schema theories.
Furthermore, ISAAC is supplied with a practical application, which extends the Framester schema, operationalising image schemas in knowledge graphs extracted from text.




Comparing different, at times conflicting, theoretical accounts on one and the same phenomenon represents a highly challenging task. At the same time, it is an essential task to obtain a comprehensive overview of theoretical contributions on a specialized topic, and position one's own work. Ontologies are a means to explicitly represent theories: we propose an ontology-based comparison  approach to reconcile different image-schematic theories. At the same time, we aims at producing a semantic operationalization of image schemas through a sensorimotor grounding of knowledge graphs extracted from text.

### What is ISAAC?

ISAAC is a modular ontology for Image Schema Analysis And Comparison, building a new top image schematic roles level on frames represented and formalized in [Framester](https://github.com/framester/Framester).
Its design applies the [COntPare]() methodology for epistemic ontology comparison at the domain of image schema theories.
Furthermore, ISAAC is supplied with a practical application, which extends the Framester schema, operationalising image schemas in knowledge graphs extracted from text.




Comparing different, at times conflicting, theoretical accounts on one and the same phenomenon represents a highly challenging task. At the same time, it is an essential task to obtain a comprehensive overview of theoretical contributions on a specialized topic, and position one's own work. Ontologies are a means to explicitly represent theories: we propose an ontology-based comparison  approach to reconcile different image-schematic theories. At the same time, we aims at producing a semantic operationalization of image schemas through a sensorimotor grounding of knowledge graphs extracted from text.

### Johnson1987 module

The ontological transposition of the first five chapters of Mark Johnson's "The Body in the Mind".
This theory was chosen because it is the beginning of the last 40 years of studies about embodied cognition, moving first steps in 1987 and still very alive and in need of further work.


### Mandler and Pag치n C치novas module

The ontological version of [1](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/39255761/54d803e90cf2970e4e764653.pdf?1445107592=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DOn_defining_image_schemas.pdf&Expires=1620342019&Signature=LcS38kkqdWTN3F6HumKPZ~xa4rIc8Q5MV2hevqclSLpmWsryhKI3496FcZwYljKbGeSNlvmfv-OBIOzCY37FGH4oedAVdHTNDzvNoVfdIQ7Zzru3daKdTWrypGIsKuGOHgwF46J7-Mr9SDoHtG7H9MeNA1TqHFNwhdt1xVQ62OuAuJk27kXSr1y~RHqVqTC7l~GbFVwQ9us8zzcWfUiLkFTX89rz3b0sGYdVpyze6PVEaYdYFY8DhQUgBFi5ppPbT9VkbwF5Akn7Y7WQ2Y18Vyms6n3LPSqNdnL-mEcOquBDxueaslGOZ~xruftZzTgYYxQPVxFHARRdDPbe7A0NDg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA). This module was chosen for the importance of introducing spatial primitives, namely the first spatial building blocks, and introducing some light formalization in the compositionality of image schemas.


### Hedblom Module

The ontological version of the image schema theory elaborated by Hedblom et al. in [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13218-019-00605-1), [2](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3167132.3167233?casa_token=jA3_AHLyUroAAAAA:r1dve2UFBe2nfhN0nHn8irpKYRhH-MQdqbCpzvZvAJyNO8UzPJ6K3ZdBwOrN3T7ZTlOX4yPZQxU), [3](https://www.inf.unibz.it/~okutz/resources/Choosing-the-Right-Path_-Image-Schema-Theory-as-a-Foundation-for-Concept-Invention-(JAGI).pdf) and [4](http://aiia2017.di.uniba.it/wp-content/uploads/Hedblom.pdf).
This module was chosen for its importance in formalizing image schemas structure, image schemas combinations and image schemas complexity depending on the reuse of spatial primitives.


### ISCAT module

The module obtained from the reorganization of [1](http://zope.psyergo.uni-wuerzburg.de/iscat) in a well documented CSV file available [here](https://github.com/dgromann/ImageSchemaRepository).

## ISL to OWL

This is the ontological transposition of Image Schema Logic (ISL) network translated from ISL-FOL to OWL2.


The ISL-FOL is taken from Maria Hedblom - [Image Schemas and Concept Invention](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030473280).


ISL reuses RCC8, QCT, and other theories.
The full expressivity of DOL cannot be attained in OWL2: a best approximation is provided in OWL2, typically equivalence axioms for binary relations with intersection or union set builders are reduced to subproperty axioms.


The reused vocabulary is contained and minimally axiomatised in the GeneralVocabulary module.


The closure importing all the submodules could be recgnized as having "closure" in the name.

# Image Schema Net

Commonsense knowledge is a broad and challenging area of research which investigate our understanding of the world as wellas human assumptions about the reality of facts inside and outside the single individual. Deriving directly from the subjectiveperception of the external world this makes it intrinsically intertwined with embodied cognition, and commonsense reasoningin particular is linked to human pattern recognition ability. This work proposes a new resource, part of this line of research,formalizing image-schematic layer of cognition. Image Schemas, in fact, are recurring, dynamic patterns which takes originfrom our perceptual interactions and motor programs and enable our sense-making cognitive activity conferring coherence andstructure to entities, events and situations we experience everyday. ImageSchemaNet is a resource in ontological form whichalignes many pre-existing resources like FrameNet, VerbNet, WordNet, from the Framester hub to Image Schema theory andoperationalize it providing vast lexical coverage and multi-layered semantic structures alignments.
